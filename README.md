# social-links-profile-i
As a challenge by Frontend Mentor, I was tasked with recreating a simple social links profile that is responsive to both mobile and desktop screens!

This version for the challenge fits the original design reference as closely as possible, which you can view in browser through the link below. You can also see the personalized submission repo on my profile.
