## Overview

As a challenge by Frontend Mentor, I was tasked with recreating a simple social links profile that is responsive to both mobile and desktop screens!

This version for the challenge fits the original design reference as closely as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned

When I first started this project, I felt nervous and lacked confidence in my coding skills since I was a complete beginner. However, as I began visualizing how to recreate the profile and organizing my HTML, the process became much easier.

I made significant improvements in using semantic markup and class naming, which helped streamline my workflow. I also became more comfortable with Flexbox and positioning for layout, which allowed me to structure elements more effectively. The links are probably my favorite part where I improved my understanding of transitions to add subtle animations, making the design feel more dynamic and engaging.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - Transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) - This helped me get a basic understanding of transitions that I could build off on and experiment with.
